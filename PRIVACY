Privacy Policy

TL;DR All information is kept locally inside your installation
of Trailer and PocketTrailer, nothing is ever sent or processed
beyond that.

API Key

Trailer and PocketTrailer require your generated API key in
order to create API calls to GitHub and fetch your data, as well
as optional URLs for using Enterprise GitHub API servers.  This
info is stored locally on your device and never sent or otherwise
processed in any way, beyond being used inside the locally
executing app to construct the required API calls to GitHub.

GitHub Login

PocketTrailer, specifically, displays an inline web-view
where you can directly browse your PRs inside the app.  In
order to view your PRs you may need to provide login
information to GitHub's web interface.  This is done directly
inside the web-view and PocketTrailer never reads, intercepts, or
stores any of that information, beyond what may be done at a
lower level by the system web view control, to which
PocketTrailer has no access to.
