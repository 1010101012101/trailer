Privacy Policy

TL;DR All information is kept locally inside your installation
of Trailer, nothing is ever sent or processed beyond that.

API Key

Trailer requires your generated API key in order to create
API calls to GitHub and fetch your data, as well as optional
URLs for using Enterprise GitHub API servers.  This info is
stored locally on your device and never sent or otherwise
processed in any way, beyond being used inside the locally
executing app to construct the required API calls to GitHub.

GitHub Login

The iOS version of Trailer, specifically, displays an
inline web-view so you can directly browse your items
inside the app.  In order to view your private items you may
need to provide login information to GitHub's web interface.
This is done directly inside the web-view and Trailer never
reads, intercepts, or stores any of that information, beyond
what may be done at a lower level by the system web view
control, to which Trailer has no access to.
